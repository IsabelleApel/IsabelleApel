## Hi, I'm Isabelle👋

# About Me
🧑‍💻 I have a strong passion for building user-friendly, clean and responsive interfaces, and I am currently studying Frontend Development at Folkuniversitetet. Through my education I've gained solid skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, along with a good understanding of UX/UI design principles. I'm also exploring the backend side of web development using Node.js, and will continue deepening those skills in the upcoming semester.

📅 In January 2026, I’ll start my internship (LIA-praktik), and I’m currently looking for a company where I can grow, contribute, and continue developing as a web developer.

If you're looking for a motivated frontend developer with a growing fullstack mindset — feel free to reach out!
